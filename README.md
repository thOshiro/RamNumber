# RamNumber

## Brief app description
  Simple game in which a grid of 4x4 is show to the player. Some of the grid spaces will contain numbers, which the player needs to memorise their position in ascending order.
After a few seconds the grid will hide the numbers, so the player must click in those same grid spaces where the numbers were in ascending order.
Each time the player gets the order correctly the time to memorise the numbers order will reduce, until ultimately reachs the last level.

## Purpose
  A hands-on practice using MVP architecture.
  The main focus of this application is to practice how the components will interact with each other.
